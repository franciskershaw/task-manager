# Task Manager (Flask App)
## Code Institute walkthrough project

[Link to live site](https://flask-task-manager-fran.herokuapp.com/).

This walkthrough project as part of the Code Institute's diploma in full stack software development centered on using python and flask to produce a task manager applying simple CRUD functionality. Lessons learnt during this project were applied to my third Milestone project, the repository of which can be found [here](https://github.com/franciskershaw/festiviews).
